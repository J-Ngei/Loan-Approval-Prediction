# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models (Random Forest & Logistic Regression) to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not based on applicant financial and demographic features.

## 📊 Features used
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Dependents
- Education
- Employment Status
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term
- Credit History
